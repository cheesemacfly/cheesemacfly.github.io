At [Deep Focus] we released our first [NuGet] package. 
It is called [uTyped] and it solves a problem we've had with many projects when using [Umbraco].

When we need to have API endpoints to return parts of our data, there is no direct support from the CMS; no easy way to get a C# model mapped to the values available in the backoffice.

You could of course create a controller inheriting from `UmbracoApi` and then query your content with `Umbraco.TypedContentAtXPath()`.

As fine as this solution is, the `IPublishedContent` object you get from your query doesn't have strongly typed properties.
You have to query them one by one providing the type and name of the property (`content.GetPropertyValue<int>("ProductId")`).

*Definitely not ideal...*

That's where we've come up with a solution we have packaged in a library. Using the `TypedContentAtXPath` method and [AutoMapper], we are able to do:

{% highlight C# %}
public class MyController : UmbracoApiController
{
    private readonly UmbracoRepository _repo;

    public TestController()
    {
        _repo = new UmbracoRepository(Umbraco);
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll()
    {
        return _repo.GetAll<Product>();
    }

    public Product Get(int id)
    {
        return _repo.GetById<Product>(id);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Granted you have setup [AutoMapper] using the provided profile:

{% highlight C# %}
protected override void ApplicationStarted(UmbracoApplicationBase umbracoApplication, ApplicationContext applicationContext)
{
    Mapper.AddProfile<UmbracoProfile<Product>>();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And of course created your expected model where the properties name match those setup in the backoffice:

{% highlight C# %}
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string ShortName { get; set; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a fairly simple example but the library can do much more so make sure to check out the documentation: <https://github.com/DeepFocus/uTyped>.
